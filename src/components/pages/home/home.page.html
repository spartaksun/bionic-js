        A quiz is a form of game or mind sport, in which the players (as individuals or in teams) attempt to answer
        questions correctly. In some countries, a quiz is also a brief assessment used in education and similar fields
        to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.
        Quizzes are usually scored in points and many quizzes are designed to determine a winner from a group of
        participants â€“ usually the participant with the highest score.
